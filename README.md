  ## Description
  This app is a CMS-style blog site where developers and aspiring developers can publish blog posts and comment on each other's posts. It follows an MVC style structure, uses Handlebars.js as a template engine, and Sequelize as the ORM. Users can read blog and comment posts but will be asked to login to create either. For authentication, this app uses the Express-Session npm.
